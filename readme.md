# Financial Chat Challenge

## Assignment
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple browser-based chat application using .NET.  
This application should allow several users to talk in a chatroom and also to get stock quotes from an API using a specific command.

## Solution

* It was created 4 applications with the following roles:
    - `SignalR:` to provide a real-time chat functionality.
    - `Bot:` so the chat could be able to invoke commands to be executed and put into a queue to get processed messages later.
    - `Consumer:` so it watches/consumes the commands that were queued and calls a Chat API with the response.
    - `Web`: simple web application that consumes the SignalR app.
